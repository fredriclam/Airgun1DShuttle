# AirGun1D

MATLAB code for simulating a 1D airgun (compressible Euler equations) coupled to a spherical bubble (modified Rayleigh-Plesset equation) and shuttle-chamber dynamics.

This code was derived from the 1D airgun-bubble model by Leighton Watson et al. (github: leighton-watson) released under the MIT license (see license_AirGun1D.txt).
